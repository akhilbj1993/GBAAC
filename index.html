Introduction
The current world heavily relies on digital technologies. For every aspect, people prefer to opt for digital technologies for their better accessibility as well as equity of services. Health is not exceptional. This study is based on the digital health aspect of M-heath (mobile-health) and its future. Concept, factors involved, benefits, possible betterment of M-health has been demonstrated in this study.
Concept of M-health
mHealth (mobile health) can be defined as the use of mobile devices as well as other associated wireless technologies connected with mobile for medical care. It can deliver good real-time information about the health condition of the individuals that might be very useful for considering suitable treatment for individuals if required. Utilisation of mobile services for educating customers on preventative healthcare facilities and services is the most significant and real-life oriented practical mHealth application. As stated by Zhu et al. (2022), Disease surveillance, epidemic outbreak tracking, treatment support, and chronic disease management are all examples of how mHealth is employed. Hence, it can be said that the practicality of M-health services has been increasing day by day in recent years. Moreover, health informatics might be also facilitated through M-health which will enhance the treatment standard in future.
Factors associated with M-health
Technological factors are one of the most critical factors associated with M-health. As mobile technology is continuously evolving generation by generation to maintain proper synchronisation the health industry also needs to be evolved. Otherwise, such evolution like mobile health might not be practical. As stated by Conboy et al. (2018), higher technological dependency might also make this m-health service not suitable for old-school people. It might be a disruptive aspect for better acceptability in society. The m-health services are still not properly developed for which they are in the hypothetical phase. It can be also considered as a critical factor as such trial technologies are more prone to error. As health is an essential aspect so minimal error is also not permissible when such technologies will be considered in practical use cases. Additionally, the cost is also a critical factor. Incorporation of suitable hardware in the mobile devices and compatible software to gain the benefits from the hardware might be quite costly at the initial phase because mass production still has not started.
M-health trends
According to a 2018 consumer survey conducted by health insurer United HealthCare Providers Inc. 36% of Americans utilised internet facilities or a mobile application for comparing healthcare services in the previous years, with the Millennials being the most likely for doing so (51%) (accenture.com, 2019). A survey of Deloitte that executed 4,530 healthcare consumers along with 624 physicians shows almost half of all respondents utilised wearables and other devices to track their health data, with 53% saying they shared that data with their doctor (accenture.com, 2019). In addition, according to an Accenture consumer survey, around 46 percent of participants used their mobile phone or any tablet for managing their health in 2017, up from 36 percent in 2016 (accenture.com, 2019). Furthermore, 36% felt technology was quite useful and important for health management, up from 30% in 2016. 90% of respondents said they were very much willing to share information from their wearable gadgets with their doctor.
Benefits of M-health
Uses of mobile phones have become very common in recent days and almost every individual uses mobile for their day-to-day tasks. Hence, consideration of services like mobile health can keep the users aware of their health conditions. As per the knowledge of Awad et al. (2021), digital health services such as M-heath will make individuals more concerned about their health. It might be a great initiative towards the betterment of the health of the entire community. Patients can effectively interact with their preferred physician as well as the preferred care team via mHealth without having to meet face to face, which can assist bridge gaps in care. For example, clinicians can use secure texting to notify parents after their child has recovered from surgery. It also enables healthcare practitioners to share information about patients with one another, such as notifying a nurse when a patient arrives for an appointment. Hence, it can be said that accessibility of the health service at the fingertips is mainly facilitated by the M-health app that is crucial to maintain the standard of society.
Drawbacks associated with M-health
The privacy regulations of mHealth apps may lag behind the other apps, which is a drawback. As per the knowledge of Mulder and Tudorica (2019), users may not always read privacy policies which might lead to an improper understanding of how vendors or other parties handle their health data. It can also result in leaking personal sensitive information that can affect the individual very badly in society. Such technologies are also more prone to cyber-attacks as they store a rapid amount of real-time data of the user. Hence, it can cause serious cyber harm to users if proper security algorithms are not developed as early as possible.
Possible betterment of M-health in future
Enhancement of security algorithms is one of the best possible improvements for M-health services. As stated by Tunc et al. (2021), the betterment of security algorithms will make the health applications and gadgets safer for the users to use on their mobile. It is crucial for preventing a breach of any personal information of the user. Moreover, the government must specify a proper data access policy for the app developers related to M-health to avoid unwanted data access which might cause illegal and unethical activities.
Conclusion
Portable health services are the future in this digital age. However, from this study, it can be concluded that digital health services such as M-health are still not completely developed for which they are not ideal to use frequently in recent days. The companies associated with such technologies must show evidence of the accuracy of their technology to ensure better accessibility of such kinds of digital health tools as heath is one of the most critical aspects.â€ƒ
